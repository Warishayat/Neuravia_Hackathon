Neuravia Hackathon Project

This repository contains the codebase for the Neuravia Hackathon project. It includes both backend and frontend components, designed to [briefly state the main functionality, e.g., “process and analyze medical images”]. The backend handles data processing and storage, while the frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
